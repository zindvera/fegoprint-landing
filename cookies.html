    <h1>Cookies Policy</h1>

    <p>This Cookies Policy explains how FegoPrint uses cookies or similar storage when you visit the website.</p>

    <h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files that a website can store on your device. They are often used to remember preferences or improve how a site works.</p>

    <h2>2. How FegoPrint uses cookies</h2>
    <p>FegoPrint uses only minimal cookies or similar browser storage. The main purpose is to improve the preview experience and avoid showing the same message too many times.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A small cookie or local storage entry may be used to remember whether you have already seen a camera preview popup, so the same message does not keep appearing on every visit.</li>
      <li>This information is limited to that setting and is not used to track you across other websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No advertising or tracking cookies</h2>
    <p>FegoPrint does not use cookies for advertising, cross‑site tracking or building marketing profiles.</p>

    <h2>4. Managing cookies</h2>
    <p>You can control or delete cookies in your browser settings.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can clear existing cookies or site data at any time.</li>
      <li>You can choose to block cookies, but some small convenience features (such as remembering that a popup has already been shown) may no longer work as expected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third‑party websites</h2>
    <p>When you click a “Buy” button or other link and go to an external store such as Amazon or Redbubble, that website may use its own cookies.</p>
    <p>Their cookies are controlled by their own policies, not by FegoPrint.</p>

    <h2>6. Updates to this policy</h2>
    <p>This Cookies Policy may be updated from time to time. When the text on this page changes, the updated policy applies from the date it is published here.</p>
