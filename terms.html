    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p>These Terms of Use explain how you may use the FegoPrint website and its preview features. By using this website you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Service description</h2>
    <p>FegoPrint is a visual preview website that lets you see how products such as wall art, stickers and wall decor may look in different environments before you visit an external store to buy them.</p>
    <p>The previews, mockups and tools are provided for information and presentation only and do not guarantee how a product will look in every real‑world situation.</p>

    <h2>2. No direct sales</h2>
    <p>FegoPrint does not sell products directly and does not handle payment, delivery or returns.</p>
    <p>“Buy” buttons and similar links on product pages lead to external stores such as Amazon, Redbubble or other seller websites, where their own terms and policies apply.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of camera and preview tools</h2>
    <p>Some features allow you to use your device camera to place products on your own walls or objects.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for how you use your device and where you point the camera.</li>
      <li>You should not use the camera features in unsafe locations or while performing activities that require your full attention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use FegoPrint in ways that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Break any applicable law or regulation.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or damage the website, its code or its servers.</li>
      <li>Attempt to copy, scrape or misuse the service in a way that harms FegoPrint or other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Content and intellectual property</h2>
    <p>Product images and mockups may belong to product owners or third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Links to external stores</h2>
    <p>Links to external stores are provided for convenience. FegoPrint does not control and is not responsible for the content, products or policies of third‑party websites.</p>
    <p>Any purchase you make on an external website is a separate agreement between you and that seller.</p>

    <h2>7. No warranties</h2>
    <p>The website and all preview tools are provided “as is” and “as available” without any guarantees.</p>
    <p>FegoPrint does not promise that the colours, sizes or positions shown in previews will be perfectly accurate in every real‑world situation or on every screen or device.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>As far as the law allows, FegoPrint is not liable for any loss or damage that results from your use of the website, the previews or links to external stores.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use may be updated from time to time. When the text on this page changes, the updated terms apply from the date they are published here.</p>
